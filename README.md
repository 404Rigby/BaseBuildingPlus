<h1>BaseBuildingPlus BETA</h1>
<h3>BaseBuildingPlus aims to bring some fun new base building elements to DayZ.</h3>
<p>This is a BETA release for those of you who just can't wait any longer! Expect bugs, bugs, oh and bugs and please be patient while we try to fix all the issues the we assume might arise...</p>
<p>We don't recommend you put this on your main server, maybe if you have a second or a test server and have people who are willing test this mod and help us get it a state of a stable release, that'd be ideal!</p>
<p>Very important, what we currently have has only been tested with two people playing together, trying to find the bugs, gameplay loop etc, so nothing is set in stone. If something is too easy or hard to craft, rai, etc, please let us know. We don't plan on adding anything else until this current beta build is about as good as we can make it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: Make sure to have the EXACT amount of needed items for build. Not over the number. Strong side of wall is facing player in the "shadow" for placing, meaning, not like the vanilla fence kits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Doors with the ability to put custom code locks on</li>
<li>Toggleable basebuilding snapping</li>
<li>Cement Mixers</li>
<li>A crafting workbench for your base</li>
<li>Secure Safe with lockable keypad</li>
</ul>
<p>All of our walls, roofs, doors are set up to mimic the destruction/build design of vanilla dayz fences and watchtowers. So if you are on the outside of the a door, wall, or top of a roof, the time it takes to
destruct the building part will take much longer than inside.</p>
<h3>Prefab building structures that are built in stages:</h3>
<p>Car Garage (we still need textures for it, so not really in yet)
Secure Storage Vault. This takes some serious building, but is fully secure.</p>
<h2>Basic farming system (currently just chickens)</h2>
<p>-Keep your chickens fed, feed them with 10 seeds in your hand, and they will happily produce eggs for you at random times!
-Eat their eggs or walk up to a chicken coop with an egg in your hand and you will be prompted to place the egg inside the coop, after about 20-30 minutes you will have a new chicken as part of your farm.</p>
<p>We will soon have a config that will let server owners disable base destruction from the outside, just like Cleetus's "disablebasedestruction". But for beta reasons we want to test the mod in this state.</p>
<h2>Building Tiers</h2>
<h3>Tier 1:</h3>
<p>Simple Wood
This features improved parts from Simple Roof mod. The parts are now buildable in stages and now includes a lockable door, opening window shutters, roof hatch and staircase.
Destruction time = 8 Minutes</p>
<h3>Tier 2:</h3>
<p>Advanced Wood
These advanced wood parts are sturdier than the log parts and can be also be upgraded to metal during construction.
Destruction time = 12 Minutes</p>
<h3>Tier 3:</h3>
<p>Metal
Constructed using metal sheets for better defense.
Destruction time = 20 Minutes</p>
<h3>>Tier 4:</h3>
<p>Concrete
The highest tier and most difficult to craft. Players will need to locate the static cement mixers around the map. The mixers need a generator connected and 2 bags of cement to create the concrete bricks needed to craft these parts.
Destruction time = 40 Minutes, can only use a sledgehammer</p>
<p>Obv, these times are subject to change!
No plans for C4 right now...</p>
